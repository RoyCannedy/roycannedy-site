    "text": "I’m a Data Science student at Baylor who loves building things with data. My work sits at the intersection of research, real projects, and practical problem-solving. I’ve developed tools and models in R and Python, worked on Bayesian network research using beta divergence, built websites for organizations, and managed live sound production for large events. I enjoy taking projects from idea to execution and collaborating with people across different roles to turn messy data into clear, useful solutions. Whether it’s research, web development, audio production, or analytics, I’m driven by creating work that is both technically strong and meaningful in the real world.\n\n\n\n\nResume\n\n \n Open Resume in New Tab\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch\n\n\nMy research focuses on Bayesian networks, chain event graphs, and alternative scoring methods using beta divergence. I work in R to build custom scoring functions and test how network structures change under contamination and uncertainty. This work connects theory with practical modeling and has led to posters, code repositories, and ongoing collaboration with faculty mentors. I enjoy exploring how statistical ideas can be turned into usable tools for real data problems.\n\n GitHub   \n Open Poster in New Tab\n\n\n\nWeb Development\n\n\nI build practical websites and tools for organizations primarily using WordPress and Quarto. From managing and updating the TLPCA WordPress site to developing my own data-driven pages and tools in Quarto, I enjoy turning ideas into clean, functional interfaces. My focus is on usability, clarity, and creating sites that are easy to maintain while still looking professional and purposeful.\n\n\nTLPCA Website Email for website development and WordPress/Quarto inquiries \n\n\n\nSound Production\n\n\nI run live audio production for churches, conferences, and large campus events, managing everything from stage setup to live mixing and teardown. This work has taught me logistics, teamwork, and staying calm under pressure while delivering a high-quality experience.\n\n\n\nFM72 — Production Intern (Tent Production)\n\n\nVertical Ministries — Contracted Sound Engineering / Roadie Volunteer\n\n\nHarris Creek Church — Sound Engineering / Production Volunteer\n\n\nWaco Weekender — Contracted Sound Engineering\n\n\nBaylor Kamp Love — Contracted Sound Engineering\n\n\nPathway waco — Contracted Sound Engineering\n\n\nFirst Methodist Church Waco — DNOW Event Sound Engineering\n\n\nPhi Chi Baylor — Contracted Sound Engineering\n\n\n\n Email for event production and sound engineering inquiries"
